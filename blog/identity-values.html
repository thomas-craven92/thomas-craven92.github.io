    <h1>Identity and Values</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <h2>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I don't eat fast food and prefer to give my money to local businesses
        instead of big conglomerates. It was a pretty easy and logical decision
        for me as I have lot's of friends with small businesses and it helps
        them out to use their services instead of big companies. I reflect
        happily on that decision.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I grew up with parents who were always looking at the world, be it the
        news or just general interest and took that into my own life through
        language and travels. It has given me an open-ness to new people and
        cultures, and a readiness to enter new and unfamiliar terrain.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h2>
      <p>
        My curiosity and interest in new ideas will support me in my learning
        journey by making each day an exciting new challenge.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h2>
      <p>
        My main limitation with learning, I think, will be attention span and
        keeping my mind on study. I’ll make sure to minimise distractions and
        also take necessary breaks to keep my mind focussed.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I worked for a few years as a bar manager and didn’t have tension
        necessarily but had to employ a few strategies to keep all of the staff
        maximising productivity. Be it looking for jobs when quiet or making
        sure to look at the entire establishment when busy and make sure you
        were using your time wisely. I’d still go back to these ideas if I
        worked within that field again.
