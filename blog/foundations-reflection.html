    <h2>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the Human Skills learning?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I’ve gotten better at asking for help, realised computers aren’t as scary
      as they seem and that I can make myself sit down for longer periods than
      I’d imagined possible!
    </p>
    <h2>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Your values help guide your decisions and actions. Empathy is an important
      trait to help understand others feelings and points of view. Good
      self-awareness is the ability to be able to be critical of your self,
      understand strengths and weaknesses, and helps you learn more effectively.
      These three all work together to create better relationships for
      working/studying and life in general.
    </p>
    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h2>
    <p>
      Not so much as surprised, but I've enjoyed havig the human skills linked
      to, and as much of a part of, the learning as the technical skills.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Probably self reflection or writing about myself, I find it hard to not be
      over critical when doing these tasks.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Getting us ready for the modern workspace and human interactions outside
      of a computer.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
      waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
      instead? Justify your answer.
    </h2>
    <p>
      No, I think it was worthwhile and I enjoyed it. It was nice to add
      reflection to my study and I think it helped cement things in my mind.
      Also, when it comes to getting a job, like we have learnt, human skills
      are regarded very highly when someone is interviewing you for a job and a
      fit for a workplace.
