    <h2>The difference between Margin, Border, and Padding when using CSS</h2>
    <div class="content bottom-margin">
      <p class="p1">
        If you are new to CSS then learning about margins, borders and padding,
        and the difference between them, is crucial to good web design. You can
        use the image below as a good reference to help understand the following
        points.
        <br />
        <br />
        It all starts with our content, this is the information we want
        displayed, for example an image or some text. We add that into the html
        document and then it is displayed very simply on our page and usually
        will need some CSS magic to help it fit in right and look good.
      </p>

      <img
        id="margin-image"
        src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*3STqKwTGNXBoZgbXbp3aDA.png"
      />
      <p class="p2">
        The border is then the framing around our content, like a picture frame
        around a painting. It can be altered, for colours, styles and many other
        design options, as well as being left out all together, if you do not
        want/require one for your content. You can see I have added a border to
        this paragraph (our content), however it is hugging our content very
        closely, that's the job of padding, we'll deal with that next.
      </p>
      <p class="p3">
        The padding is our space between the content and the border. It can be a
        uniform amount of distance around the content or you can set different
        values for the top, sides and bottom. You can see now that the border is
        further away from our content as I have added 20px of padding to out
        element.
      </p>
      <p class="p4">
        So we have our content nested inside our border which is spaced out with
        padding and finally the margin, which is the space between our border
        and other elements or the edge of a screen. You can see I have altered
        this elements margins to be further away from the other elements and the
        edge of the screen.

        I hope you found this informative and can use what you have learnt on
        your own coding journey!
