    <h2 class="sub-heading">A time I was blocked on a simple problem.</h2>
    <p>
      I found my self stuck when we were introduced to loops. There was so much
      new syntax and jargon, it felt quite overwhelming and scrambled what I had
      learnt about JS. I ended up going right back to the start of our JS intro
      videos and re-watching everything, researched terms with google and had
      chat gpt break everything down to the very simplest versions of things.<br />
      It all felt quite overwhelming at the time, but breaking down and
      simplifying everything really helped me get a small grasp on loop
      fundamentals. I learnt about a few handy resources for developers, like
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a> and how I
      can use chat gpt to help me break down code and explain each step and part
      that I am having trouble with.
    </p>
    <h2 class="sub-heading">A time I elegantly solved a problem.</h2>
    <p>
      I was pleased to find the .map method, when stuck on the superflipflop
      exercise and wanted to apply a function to objects in an array. I did some
      research through google, MDN etc until I found the .map method, which
      worked perfectly for my problem at hand. Initially I felt a bit
      overwhelmed by the exercise and then took a step back, wrote out some
      pseudocode in my notebook, did some research and re-tackled the problem. I
      learnt that stepping back, research and pseudocode are all very handy
      things to use when stuck.

    <h2 class="sub-heading">
      Reflect on how confident you feel using each of the following
      problem-solving techniques/processes.
    </h2>
    <p class="left">
      <strong>Pseudocode: </strong>I like the idea of using pseudocode and I'm
      getting better at using it as I understand the code more.<br />
      <strong>Trying something: </strong>I find trying different things or
      approaches to problems a handy way to develop my understanding of what I
      am working on, and what's working and not working.<br />
      <strong>Rubber ducky method: </strong>I like this method, it always makes
      a problem seem simpler. This method, like pseudocode, is becoming handier
      the more I understand the code we are working with.<br />
      <strong>Reading error messages: </strong>These have been very helpful and
      I encounter them very regularly!<br />
      <strong>Console.logging: </strong>This is a great feature to test code and
      I have come to rely on it when problem solving.<br />
      <strong>Googling: </strong>Another thing I have come to rely on when
      problem solving.<br />
      <strong>Asking your peers for help: </strong>I'm not great at this but
      getting better.<br />
      <strong>Asking coaches for help: </strong>Same as above.<br />
      <strong>Improving your process with reflection: </strong>A great way to
      solidify your understanding of a problem you encountered and got past. I'm
      getting better at this slowly.<br />
    </p>
    <h2 class="sub-heading">
      Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made
      you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Asking for help is something I'm not great at and I will strive to become
      better at during our course. I feel like I probably waste time struggling
      with some problems and asking for help would aid my time management.
