    <h2>
      An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A good analogy to explain the relationship between JavaScript, HTML and
      CSS is to liken it to building a house. The HTML is like the plans and
      structure of the house.<br />
      The CSS is like all of the design and decorating (eg. paint colours,
      furnishings, decor).<br />
      And, finally, JavaScript is like all of the plumbing and electricty. It
      brings it all together and makes everything work, as well as adding
      ineractivity.<br />
    </p>
    <h2>
      Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
      life.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Control flow determines the sequence of events for your code. Looping
      makes things happen more than once. For example, the order of the events
      of your day:
    </p>

    <p>Wake up</p>
    <p>Hungry? - Have Breakfast. If not, very unlikely, skip breakfast.</p>
    <p>Mon - Fri? - Go to work. If not, party time!</p>
    <p>5pm? - Go home. If not, stay at work.</p>
    <p>(!important) Walk the dog</p>
    <p>Hungry? - Have dinner. If not, also very unlikely, skip dinner.</p>
    <p>
      Tired? - Go to Bed. If not, run round the yard with the dog till you are.
    </p>
    <p>Loop/repeat.</p>

    <p>
      Your code will need set values for how many times a loop happens before a
      condition is met.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The DOM represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects.<br />
      Those working with code (including me, hopefully, one day!) would interact
      with the DOM when modifying the content, structure, and style of a webpage
      using JavaScript.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Arrays are an ordered list of items, they are indexed lists and you use
      this to access the information stored.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: [apple, orange, banana] - would be indexed like this [0, 2,
      2]. You would use these numbers to access the items.
    </p>
    <p>
      Objects are unordered collections of information and are accessed via
      names(keys).
    </p>
    <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h2>
    <p>
      Functions are blocks of code that form a specific task in your code. They
      are helpful as they can be reused, so you're not writing the same code
      over and over and cluttering up your files.
