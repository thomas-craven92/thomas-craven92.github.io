    <h1>Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p class="neuroplasticity-p1">
        Understanding neuroplasticity helps people to understand that their
        brains can change and develop at any age and that nothing is a static
        given. Once this idea is grasped it can free someone from thinking that
        they are unable to change or grow due to their current situation being
        set in stone. For instance, believing that you cannot acquire new
        intelligence or skills because of your age is an example of this
        mindset. In reality, you can transform your brain by tackling challenges
        and engaging in new activities until they become second nature. By
        learning new things, you create new neural pathways, effectively
        reshaping your brain through effort and practice. There are many ways to
        increase your neuroplasticity, some examples of these can be through
        diet, enough rest, not overloading your brain, expanding your vocabulary
        or learning a new language and doing mind drills or games. Keeping your
        brain fresh and not overworked, and thus not performing to its maximum,
        is critical but so is keeping it engaged with new challenges and
        problems to overcome.

      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

      />
      <p>
        The two different mindsets put forth in this argument are a fixed
        mindset and a growth mindset. A growth mindset is a way of thinking
        about ourselves that can drastically alter the way we learn. Those with
        a growth mindset see challenges and failures as possibilities to
        increase their own intelligence, they have a desire to learn and, when
        encountering problems, embrace these as chances to reach further heights
        of achievement. Those with a fixed mindset, on the other hand, avoid
        challenges to then avoid potential failures. If, having completed a
        problem, would not opt for a more technical one, given the chance, and
        feel threatened by the success of others. They see intelligence as a
        static given, rather than a changeable entity based on how much effort
        has been put in. Reading about the growth mindset has been very
        interesting and makes me second guess the way I think about things and
        encounter problems. I’m not sure what camp I fall into currently but
        love the idea of being able to alter one’s
        mindset/intelligence/psychology. I’ll try and integrate these ideas into
        my learning, and further into my life, by not dwelling on my failures
        and trying my best to enjoy the challenges of things unknown to me (even
        if it’s JS loops!). Much of the work done on this idea is by Stanford
        psychologist Carol Dweck, you can watch this TED talk below on ‘The
        Power of Believing That You Can Improve’. I found it very interesting
        and a good overview on the growth mindset.

      <h2>Blending with my learning plan and strategies</h2>
      <p>
        I really enjoyed learning about neuroplasticity and the growth mindset.
        The two ideas work very well together and offer a real freedom to us,
        especially while in the midst of studying. It makes the future seem like
        more of an adventure knowing that you could keep expanding your mind
        exponentially and with no real way to know what will come, so long as
        you keep challenging your brain. I’ll take these ideas into my learning
        strategy by way of my approach to challenges and problems encountered.
        Also I’d like to strive to see what other things I can add to my daily
        life to keep my mind growing and evolving.
