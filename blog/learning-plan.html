      <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        My long term goals are much the same as when I started foundations. The
        ability to work remotely from anywhere and have flexible hours.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Working on a computer has been quite enjoyable and I’ve really enjoyed
        pushing my brain with new problems and information. I have found some
        parts quite challenging but have given them appropriate time and breaks.
        I’ll take this into account when I encounter problems in bootcamp.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The main challenges I think I will face at bootcamp are keeping up
        with/on top of the material and keeping motivated.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I’ve not worked much within groups and I am not a great public speaker,
        so it would be nice to develop some skills around those.
      </p>
      <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
      <p>
        Support when I need it and to put up with a million questions from me
        when I am stuck or confused!
      </p>
      <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h2>
      <p>
        Work/study hard and to make the most of my time and resources at Dev
        Academy.
      </p>

      <h2>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to be able to work remotely from around the world and have
        flexible hours.
      </p>
      <h2>
        2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Having not worked at a computer before and coming from the background of
        a motorcycle mechanic, I think that sitting all day in front of a
        computer could prove to be a limitation but we shall see! I enjoy
        problem solving and learning new things.
      </p>
      <h2>
        3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Self motivation, as I’ve not worked/studied remotely before, this will
        be new for me.
      </p>
      <h2>
        4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      </h2>
      <p>
        4. I’ll put aside time each day to study and take breaks, and be kind to
        others that I work with. If I find myself becoming stressed or the
        workload impacting me, I will take time away from the screen to refocus,
        identify and minimise non-study stressors, and get back into it.
      </p>
      <h2>
        5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
      </h2>
      <p>
        If I become stuck, after trying to resolve the issue myself, through
        wireframing on paper or sitting back and looking at the problem from a
        different angle, I will ask for help from my classmates and
        facilitators.
