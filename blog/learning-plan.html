    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <h2>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to be able to work remotely from around the world and have
        flexible hours.
      </p>
      <h2>
        2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Having not worked at a computer before and coming from the background of
        a motorcycle mechanic, I think that sitting all day in front of a
        computer could prove to be a limitation but we shall see! I enjoy
        problem solving and learning new things.
      </p>
      <h2>
        3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Self motivation, as I’ve not worked/studied remotely before, this will
        be new for me.
      </p>
      <h2>
        4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      </h2>
      <p>
        4. I’ll put aside time each day to study and take breaks, and be kind to
        others that I work with. If I find myself becoming stressed or the
        workload impacting me, I will take time away from the screen to refocus,
        identify and minimise non-study stressors, and get back into it.
      </p>
      <h2>
        5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
      </h2>
      <p>
        If I become stuck, after trying to resolve the issue myself, through
        wireframing on paper or sitting back and looking at the problem from a
        different angle, I will ask for help from my classmates and
        facilitators.
